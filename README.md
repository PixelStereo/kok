#Ola Pyqt Gui

This is a DMX application that used the wonderful OLA framework. ([open-lighting-architecture](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/))

It's developed on OSX with python 2.7 and PyQt5 but it might work on linux too and windows.    
Windows users will only have access to a [restricted numbers of protocols](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/) (only Artnet for now).    

##Roadmap
###Version 0.1
* ~~Display DMX values~~
* ~~Select a uiverse to display~~
* ~~Display Name and Merge Mode~~
* ~~Launch/kill Ola server on startup/exit~~
* ~~Edit Universe name and merge mode~~
* ~~Use dedicated embeded conf files~~
* Create and patch universes/devices
* Embed an independant OLA in the app
* Tests with full code coverage    

###Ideas for the future    
* Create an interface to send DMX (only if universe have no input)  
* Implement RDM discovery / patch    
* Create an editor for ola_trigger
